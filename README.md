# Plugin Setup

## General settings

You should specify all the necessary notification protocols in the "Protocols" section. These are 'telegram' and 'email' available at the moment.

The section "Working days" should contain:

* when the workday starts and when it ends
* what days are considered as workdays

The section "Urgent Tasks" contains the ticket priorities, that will have notifications being sent despite of the time or day of a week.

The plugin contains the fuctionality that allows you to send scheduled notifications tagged as "In work" or "Feedback". Specify these statuses in appropriate sections so the plugin could parse them correctly.

### Bot launch

Specify the following things before launching the bot:

* Working Time - when and what notifications will be sent
* Specify what priorities should be considered as urgent ones
* Specify what statuses should be considered _in work_ and _feedback_
* Save settings

### Adding a Telegram account to the user

User needs to add a bot with `/start` command.

After that the bot prompts to enter the command `/connect account@redmine.com`.

After the command, the user will receive an email with a link.

Following the link will connect the user's accounts.

#### If the bot has been changed

If you have changed the bot, then each user needs to greet it personally.
One has to connect to the new bot if it has been changed. To do that all the participating Users should find the new bot via search and type the `/start` command again.

### Adding a Telegram Group

The groups are added to Redmine, if the bot was added to them.

The group name is saved on addition. Issue the `/rename` command in the group chat to change the group name in Redmine.
